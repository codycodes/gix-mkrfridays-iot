# object. You can create the object directly using ResourceGroup(location=LOCATION)
# or you can express the object as inline JSON as shown here. For details,
# see Inline JSON pattern for object arguments at
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-overview#inline-json-pattern-for-object-arguments.
