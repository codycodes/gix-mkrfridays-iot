## About
The NodeMCU is an open-source firmware and development kit which allows us to use a low-cost ESP8266 Wi-Fi MCU to provide ‚Äúthe best platform for IOT application development at the lowest cost‚Äù [NodeMCU homepage](https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html).  

ESPHome is the software and firmware flasher we‚Äôll be using; it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsystem to control your ESP8266/ESP32 by simple yet powerful configuration files and control them remotely through Home Automation systems‚Äù [ESPHome homepage](https://esphome.io).

# Local Control (via ESPHome)

## Software Setup

To make the process easier, you don't need to assemble everything while you set up the software. **You just need to plug your servo to the NodeMCU.** After the software is setup successfully you can then attach them to the box.

*Prerequisites*
- working Wi-Fi, you know the SSID(name) & password
- computer or phone or any other device with Wi-Fi and a web browser

We've already flashed the basic program, all you need to do is follow the below steps and connect it to your Wi-Fi.

### What We're Gonna Do - The Overall Process
This is just a high level walkthrough; detailed steps to follow are in the next section.
- Connect to NodeMCU Wi-Fi
- Tell it your own Wi-Fi name and password
- Let it connect to your Wi-Fi
- Connect your phone back to your own Wi-Fi
- Use your own Wi-Fi to browse to the device's web server to control it

### Detailed Steps 
1. Plug in the micro USB cable for the NodeMCU (just for providing power, don't need to connect to a computer)
2. Use your device (PC/phone) and connect to the Wi-Fi netowrk: "gix_iot"
3. Password: "gixmkrspc"
4. Wait for the webpage to popup, you will see this:
![ap_screenshot](./assets/ap_screenshot.png)
> (If the page didn't show up after you connected to the Wi-Fi, try to go to http://192.168.4.1/)
>
> An iPhone or Android device may change the Wi-Fi network back to your home network, since the NodeMCU doesn't have an Internet connection. You may need to ensure that "Auto Join" is turned off for your other Wi-Fi (iPhone) or forget the other network (Android); this step is only to get the NodeMCU onto your home network and then you can re-join and/or turn on "Auto Join" for your home Wi-Fi again.
5. Enter your **own Wi-Fi's** SSID(name) & password,
 you can use your home Wi-Fi, phone hotspot, etc.
6. After you see this message, **Press RST button on the NodeMCU**, let the NodeMCU reboot and connect to your own Wi-Fi
![Wi-Fi_setup](./assets/Wi-Fisetup_screenshot.png)
7. Disconnect your device from "gix_iot" and **reconnect your device to your own Wi-Fi**
8. Open your browser and go to [http://servo_test.local](http://servo_test.local) you will see this page:
![control_screenshot](./assets/control_screenshot.png)
> If you can't see this page, try refreshing the page several times in 1-2 minutes. After 1-2 minutes, if you still can't see this page. Go back to step **2.** and connect to "gix_iot" again. This time you might get a Wi-Fi list in your popup page, connect to the Wi-Fi you want.

9. Click Toggle, you can move the servo now üëã!
  
### Congratulations! üëèüëèüëè
Now that the Wi-Fi connection is configured, your NodeMCU will automatically connect to your Wi-Fi every time it boots up.

10. You can attach the servo and board to the enclosure

<img src="./assets/finish1.jpg" height="300">
<img src="./assets/finish2.jpg" height="300">
</div>

> If you want to connect to another Wi-Fi, turn off or get away from the Wi-Fi signal you previously connected to. Once the NodeMCU failed to connect to Wi-Fi, it will start "ap mode" and you can reset it from step **2.**

> In the future we will have other activities involving this device! Please see the section below, tinker and bring any ideas or changes up so we can bring that functionality to other cohort members!

## Extensibility
As the microcontroller is easily reprogrammable, the hand wave can be triggered, or its action changed by possibilities only limited by your imagination! For instance, you can easily hook ESPHome into an automation platform called Home Assistant, which will allow you to wave the hand for all sorts of triggers; for instance, if someone opens your door, you can use the ESPHome to wave. You can also change the hand itself to become an indicator; since we‚Äôre using a servo, you can control the state, or how much, the servo rotates. You can make the hand move to different positions depending on whether it‚Äôs cloudy or sunny and make the servo rotate to that predefined position when the weather changes.

## Custom Development Setup
In order to customize the microcontroller, you have to re-flash the NodeMCU again. Below are the steps that you need to do.

### For Windows:
1. Set up a new virtual environment in Python
- make sure you have python installed (open Command Prompt and type in `python`; if it opens python shell then you've confirmed Python is accessible in your Path; otherwise reinstall Python and ensure you check the box to add it to your system's path environment variable)
- locate the directory you want the virtual environment to be installed in
- in the Windows Command Prompt, enter "python -m venv venv"
  - This command invokes the python module *venv* (first parameter) and creates it inside a directory named *venv* (second parameter)
- then run `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.bat`
  - This command activates the virtual environment; you should now see your command prompt prepended with **(venv)**
- IF using Power Shell (instead of command prompt), use `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - This command activates the virtual environment; you should now see your command prompt prepended with **(venv)**
- ‚ö†Ô∏èensure that servo is not connected to the NodeMCU before next step
2. Installing esphome
- enter `pip install esphome`
1. Download or `git clone` the [repo](https://github.com/codycodes/gix-mkrfridays-iot/archive/master.zip) and extract it anywhere (best is to put it in same folder as your venv)
- in the standalone folder, right-click and create new text document.
- copy and paste these into it.
    ap_ssid: "Servo Test Fallback Hotspot"
    ap_pass: "test12341234"
    ota_pass: "test12341234"
- rename file name to "secrets.yaml" (ensure the file extension is `.yaml` and **not** `.txt`)
4. Run!
- in Command Prompt, type and run `cd *path to the standalone folder*`
- then `esphome servo.yaml run`
- it should start installing 
- DONE!
5. You can now develop your own custom esphome components! Get started on [esphome.io](http://esphome.io)
### For macOS/Linux
1. Ensure you have python3 [installed](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/)
2. Open your favorite terminal app
3. run `./install.sh`
4. run `./run.sh`
    - You can replace the `servo.yaml` file here with your own configuration!
